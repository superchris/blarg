description: A quick introduction to building sites with Eleventy
---

Eleventy is a fantastic static site generator. Here's why I chose it for this blog.

## Why Eleventy?

1. **Simple** - No complex configuration needed
2. **Fast** - Builds are lightning quick
3. **Flexible** - Use any templating language you want
4. **Zero client-side JavaScript** - Unless you want it

## The Basics

To create a new post, just add a markdown file to the `src/posts/` folder with some front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2024-01-20
---
```

That's it! Eleventy handles the rest.
